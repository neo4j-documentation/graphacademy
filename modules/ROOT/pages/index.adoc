== Take A Free Course

These free, self-paced courses introduce you to and teach you about Neo4j, Cypher, graph data modeling, graph algorithms, and Neo4j administration. 
Each course includes hands-on exercises so you can gain experience with Neo4j.

// remind: we cannot generate the course cards dynamically because we are using two distinct playbook to generate the training courses pages and the GraphAcademy informational pages.
